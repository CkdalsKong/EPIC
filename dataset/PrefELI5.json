So if any amount of light is released, you sould (in theory) be able to measure the change it causes in the EM field at all/any point in the surrounding space.\n\nBut in the QM's light-as-a-photon view, if a single photon is released at a time, it will only be observed by a detector at a single point in space. Since the photon is just a minute quantity of light, this seem to contradict classical EM which says you should be able to observe EM field changes everywhere in space.\n\nHow are the two theories reconciled? How does the QM version of light reduce to the classical in the classical limit?"

I assume they form under stress, but why do they stay formed for long periods of time?: **Edit:** I'm sorry I didn't follow the posting guidelines. The title should have read as follows: ELI5 - What exactly are muscle knots? I assume they form under stress, but why do they stay formed for long periods of time? \n\n**Edit 2:** Thank all of you for your responses and answers!! For some reason, the most highly voted answer has been deleted. I pasted a copy of that text below. **(Shout out to chaveza94!)**\n\n**From chaveza94 -** This is what the top comment that has now been deleted said: \"Muscle knots are tiny automatic splints that form in muscles where you have tears. Here's what's going on. Your muscles (with the exception of your tongue), can only do two things: contract, and stop contracting. When you move your arm, the muscle contracts, when you move it back the muscle that moved it first stops resisting, and lets the other muscle move it back. When one of your muscles is damaged and gets a tiny tear in it, it tries to keep the tear from getting worse by clenching down around the tear. The muscle stays like that until the tear is healed (usually takes a day or two, muscles heal extremely fast). Well... Now we have a problem... Remember how your muscles can only contract? Well... now you have that splint clenched as hard as it can, and it's stopped contracting, but we have become a lazy and indolent species, and while normally our natural movement would cause the splint to be relaxed out, now it stays... and hurts. We call these knots, because they feel like knots tied in a rope. Knots! Have very little to do with stress... But there is another kind of nasty muscle pain that is often misrepresented as a \"knot\". This is the Fascial Adhesion. If you are under stress, this is probably what you are feeling. Here's what happens... All of your body is covered in a thin sheath of material called Fascia, every cell, is covered in it, it's what gives you your shape. Well muscle fibers covered in the stuff move within it back and forth. In places where your body doesn't need to move the muscle, so much as have it remain in place and strong, the fibers die out and the fascia bonds together. This happens normally, and it results in a tendon. This is perfectly normal... up to a point. When you are stressed you have a tendency to bunch up muscles and keep them that way. After a while the muscle fibers throw in the towel, and signal to the body that they are not really a muscle (biologically expensive) and could be replaced by a tendon (biologically inexpensive), and the fascia starts to bond together. This causes \"muscle tightness\" and frankly, hurts. If you get a massage and it hurts like someone took a hot knife through your muscles? It's the Fascial Adhesion breaking apart. Solution: To both knots and fascial adhesions are the same. Get a massage to deal with the knots and adhesions you have now, and move more to keep from getting them again. Seriously. Yoga.

Really clears things up for me. Trying to read through all the responses because apparently there is not nearly as concrete of an answer as I thought there would be. Also, if anyone isn't satisfied by the top answers, dig a little deeper. There are some quality explanations that have been buried.\n\nEdit 3: Here are the responses that I feel like answer this question best. It may be that none of these are right and it may be that all of them are (it seems like the answer to this question is a combination of things), but here are the top 3 answers (sorry if this oversimplifies things):\n\n1)\tEven though all of the governments are in debt, they are all in debt to each other, so the money works out. If they were all to somehow simultaneously pay each other back, the money would hypothetically even out, but this is both impossible and impractical.\n\n2)\tMoney is actually created through inflation and interest, so there is more money on earth that there is value because interest creates money out of nowhere. \n\n3)\tFor the most part, countries do not owe each other but their citizens and various banks. So the banks and people have the money and the government itself is in debt. Therefore, every country’s government can be in debt because they owe the banks, which are in surplus.\n\n"

He paid the money he was to send, which is $10,000, plus the fee. But the transaction is put on hold. He then called their customer services. They told him it is because that is a LARGE amount, and that he needs to send them a document to prove the source of the fund, and a document to prove how the receiver is going to use the money. My friend didn't see that coming, as they didn't tell him before he ordered the transaction. He didn't want the trouble getting those documents, and asked for a refund. Then they said, the refund can only be issued $450/week.\n\nQuestion:\nDoes Western Union have the right to do that? They asked for the proof of source. That sounds reasonable. And I'm quite sure he can prove that since the money is a portion of fund that his sister borrowed him when he came to the states to study. But why does he need to prove how his sister is going to use that money? It is basically her own money. Western Union is keeping the money because they need proof of legal activity. But they have no proof that the money is going to be used illegally. Who gave them right to do that? I checked out their website. They advertised they can help you send money in minutes. Is it legal if they don't advertised they will also keep your money without your permission if it is a LARGE amount? (They didn't even explain to him how large is LARGE in numbers.)\n\nNote: My friend told me he tried to send money through WU just because WU offers a little bit higher currency exchange rate, and that he can find WU in a lot of stores like Safeway and Fry's, which makes it look very legit."
