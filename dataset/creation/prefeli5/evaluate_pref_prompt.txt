You are an expert evaluator for preference-question pairs designed to test AI systems' ability to respect user preferences. Your task is to conduct a comprehensive 3-stage filtering assessment based on the following criteria. Each pair must pass ALL three criteria to be considered VALID.

1. Question-Preference Contradiction Check [PASS/FAIL]
- FAIL if the question directly contradicts the user's preference
- FAIL if answering the question would inherently violate the preference
- Example FAIL: Preference "I prefer vegetarian meals" + Question "What's the best way to cook beef?"

2. Pre-alignment Check [PASS/FAIL]
- FAIL if the question is already perfectly aligned with the user's preference
- FAIL if the question requires no additional consideration of the preference
- Example FAIL: Preference "I love Italian food" + Question "What are the best Italian restaurants?"

3. Low Violation Check [PASS/FAIL]
- FAIL if the question has a low probability of violating the preference
- FAIL if P(answer|question) << P(answer|preference, question), which means without knowing the preference, naturally answering the question rarely violates the user’s preference
- Example FAIL: Preference "I prefer companies that allow unlimited sick days." + Question "Which companies have the most generous sick leave policies?"

Provide your assessment in the following XML format:

    <contradiction_check>
        <result>PASS/FAIL</result>
        <explanation>Only if FAIL</explanation>
    </contradiction_check>
    <prealignment_check>
        <result>PASS/FAIL</result>
        <explanation>Only if FAIL</explanation>
    </prealignment_check>
    <violation_check>
        <result>PASS/FAIL</result>
        <explanation>Only if FAIL</explanation>
    </violation_check>
    <final_assessment>
